## ALU student management system
### Project description
In this project, we will design a program to help the registrar's office of ALU store, update and view information about the students promote a student, change student status when the student graduates, help students easily access their degree program outline, and allow them to add information about their internships. All students will have some common information like their contact information, email address, names, and other crucial personal information.  The program will store information about students information specific to their degree programs i.e: recording information about students’ ventures for International Business and Trade (IBT) and Entrepreneurship degree programs, Computer science students should have accounts on GitHub so their user names should be recorded but not necessarily their user emails as they are mandated to use their student emails. Students in the Global Challenges (GC) degree program must have a mission related to one of the global challenges/opportunities. Students should be able to view the courses they will be taking in their degree program. Moreover, the registrar's office should be able to update students’ information when needed. For instance, change the students’ status regarding whether they are current students or graduates and promote them to the next year. 
###Technology used
This project is purely written in python language and was developed in pycharm.
### Program future improvement
1. Checking user password before allowing them to access registrar or student priviledges
2. Assigning emails automatically upon student registration without the user having to manually come up with them, and ensuring that no two students have a similar email.
